The background section is to provide the reader with context to understand your paper. You may include a summary of your literature survey. Note that one of the reasons that you write a paper is to teach your work and conclusions to others.  Consider you are teaching someone who does not know anything about your research areas. Provide the background that would help understand your research. 

I recommend writing the related work section toward the end of the paper.
